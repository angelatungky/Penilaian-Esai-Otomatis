do while statements evaluate whether or not to loop after running the block contained within it at least once So the main differance is that while statements have a possibility of never being used Do while statements on the other hand are always run at least once before evaluating whether to run again,a while statement will only process if the statement is met while a do while will always process once then only continue if the statement is met,statements evaluate whether loop running block contained within least main differance statements possibility never used statements hand always run least evaluating whether run,statement process statement met always process continue statement met,5.0,3.325000000000003

a static array will store the new values that were assigned to each of its elements meaning if you call a function twice it will use the last values that were returned the first time if you do not declare it static then the new values will not be stored and will be reset to their original value,a static array is allocated when the program starts and is freed when the program exits but has limited scope while an array that is not declared static is allocated and freed when it comes into and out of scope,static array store new values assigned elements meaning call function twice use last values returned first time declare static new values stored reset original value,static array allocated program starts freed program exits limited scope array declared static allocated freed comes scope,5.0,3.9299999999999975
